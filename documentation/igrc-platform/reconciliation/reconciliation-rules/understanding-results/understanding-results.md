You can see the results of your rule at any time by selecting the 'results' tab in the graphical editor. 

This tab has two sub-tabs:   

# Rule simulation sub-tab

This sub-tab allows you to simulate the result of the rule, generally speaking, and/or to save the rule in the Ledger.

- When the results are correct, you can execute the rule by clicking on the ![Icon](../images/worddav4ccd9abc9a832ce7a18df6841a8b4b2e.png "Icon") icon. This command writes the reconciliations in the Ledger.
- The ![Icon](../images/worddav8e4262e53c96c05af6772c69f3ab4565.png "Icon") icon deletes all the reconciliation and from current the analysis period and loads manual and automatic reconciliations from the last analysis period onto the Ledger.

# The 'Ledger' sub-tab

You can see the results of your rule at any time by selecting the **'Results'** then the **'Ledger'** sub-tab. Reconciliation is performed on the last loaded analysis period and the results are displayed in the form of a master/detail list.
