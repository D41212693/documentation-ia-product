It is possible to configure the behaviour of the audit viewing engine once links between the concepts have been established. Two types of join are available in this manner. They relate to join families based on SQL standards.   

- [Inner Join](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Join_%28SQL%29#Inner_join)
- [Left Outer Join](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Join_%28SQL%29#Left_outer_join)

The default join when a relationship is implemented is a 'left value' (LEFT) join. Double clicking on this value enables the user to switch to an inner join (INNER) instead.
