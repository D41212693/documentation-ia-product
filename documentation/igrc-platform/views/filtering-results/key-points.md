It is possible to filter the results returned by an Audit View so as to retrieve only a part of the information contained within the Identity Ledger.    
Two methods are available to filter the results of an Audit View:   

- By applying tests on values or attributes
- By using audit rules

Here, we are concerned with filtering by applying tests on attribute values.     
It is possible to attach a condition to multiple attributes, or to attach multiple conditions to one attribute. The filter function therefore enables the user to carry out a detailed extraction of information contained in the Identity Ledger for analysis or reporting purposes.
