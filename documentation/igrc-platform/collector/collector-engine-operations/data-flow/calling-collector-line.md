A collector line may be called from another collector line. Hiding behind this feature are two different objectives:   

- Create a data source functionally richer than the source components provided as standard.
- Run one collector line from another.

From a more technical point of view, a sub-collector line is a normal collector line with a primary source and target or filter components. In the main collector line, the sub-line can be used as a source or as a filter. Depending on the option chosen, the kinematics of dataset movement is different:

|**Type of call**|**Operation**|**Datasets returned**|
|Source|The Sub-collector line replaces a source type component and behaves in exactly the same way. The sub-collector line should list the records and return them to the calling line collector in the form of datasets. The only difference is in the wealth of processes able to be performed by the sub-line because it may include as many components as necessary to shape the dataset to return to the main line.|The datasets generated by the sub-collector line are returned to the main collector line. An ending point must be defined in the sub-line to specify the component that will give its datasets to the calling line.|
|Filter|The sub-collector line is called each time a dataset is transmitted in the main collector line. However, the sub-line is not part of the main line with, for example, some filters which are linked but it is a complete line with a source type component. Overall, this means that the called collector line is not a sub-line but is an autonomous collector line in terms of data. It does not receive the dataset from the main line and it does not return a dataset. It simply triggers another collector line.|The Sub-collector line does not return any dataset. Therefore, the definition of an ending point in the sub-line is not useful.|

In general, the sub-collector lines in source mode are designed to create source component libraries with verticalized semantics. This is the best way to add repository support applications such as HR databases or business application accounts database exports to the product. The consultant can thus, through the various projects, compile a whole collection of reusable lines. When the collector line is stable, it becomes interesting to consider it as a black box by packaging it as a source component. The collector line and all its dependencies are then transformed into a file component in the library directory of the project. All the components packaged in this way appear in the palette of the source component of the collector line editor just like the standard components of the product.   
The collector lines in filter mode have a very different purpose. It is actually a question of making a main collector line which links all the lines created during a project. This allows us to launch a single line that runs all the lines in the desired order. This mode of operation is similar to a batch (in DOS mode) or a shell script (in Unix mode) that would call each collector line one by one.
