Some components can generate events to which the designer of the collector line gives a name. The semantics of events is fixed for the standard components. However, it is possible to trigger an event with a JavaScript function. In this case, the semantics of the event are only known to the creator of the collector line.   
An event consists of a name chosen by the designer of the collector line and of a context (the reference of the component that issued the event and the dataset at the onset of the event). An example of an event is the failure to reconcile an account with an identity in the target account.   
Once an event is triggered, there are two immediate consequences:

- The event is added to the current dataset. This allows us, when the component exits, to test for the presence of the event in the transition to make the execution of the following components conditional.
- The event is saved in a log file whose prefix is event and whose suffix is csv.

This log file is in CSV format so it can be read in a spreadsheet-type tool. It contains at a minimum the name of the event given by the collector line's designer, a descriptive text generated by the component, the name of the component that triggered the event, and a dataset dump at the time the event was detected.   
The log file is only created in the log directory if at least one event is detected. If runtime concludes with no event being triggered, then the log file is not created in the log directory.
